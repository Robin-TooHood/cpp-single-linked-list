Final student project: single linked list

# About

In this project, I developed a single linked list in which I worked with pointers, memory leaks, exception safety and covered it with unit tests.

# Deployment Instructions and System Requirements

The project is written in VS Code on Windows and uses C++17, so to run it you need:
1. IDE
2. Compiler

Deployment example:
* Download and install VS Code [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install the C++ extension in VS Code
* Install the latest MinGW release [winlibs.com](https://winlibs.com/#download-release) and add it to PATH
* Clone the repository
* Run main.cpp file with g++ build
* Output should look like this:
